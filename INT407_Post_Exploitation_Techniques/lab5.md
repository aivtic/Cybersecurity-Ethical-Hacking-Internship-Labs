# Practice: Reflection Questions

1. **You have exploited a vulnerability and gained access to devices on the network. So now what?**  
   Gaining access is just part of an attack. Why is merely gaining access during a pentest not enough? Persistence in a pentest means gaining access and maintaining a presence in the network that can be used in various ways. What are some of the things that pen testers (and threat actors) do while they have prolonged access to a network?

2. **In order to maintain persistent access, it is necessary to avoid detection. If network security personnel become aware of your presence and activities, they will take measures to not only deny you access, but to also determine and mitigate the vulnerabilities and exploits that allowed you access.**  
   This will make it much more difficult to regain access in the future. What sort of activities could alert security personnel to your presence? What can you do to make detection of your activities more difficult while you continue to exploit the network?
