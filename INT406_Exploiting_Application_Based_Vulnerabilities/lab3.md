# Lab 3: Web Vulnerability Scanning using OWASP Broken Web Applications VM

---

### Objectives:
In this lab, you will complete the following objectives:

- **Part 1**: Launch Nikto and Perform a Basic Scan
- **Part 2**: Use Nikto to Scan Multiple Web Servers
- **Part 3**: Investigate Website Vulnerabilities
- **Part 4**: Export Nikto Results to a File

### Background / Scenario:
Nikto is a widely-used web vulnerability scanner designed to identify common security issues like SQL injection, XSS, misconfigurations, and outdated components in web applications. In this lab, you will utilize **OWASP Broken Web Applications VM** as the target environment, which contains a variety of vulnerable web applications. **Note**: The IP address of the OWASP VM varies; ensure that you confirm the correct IP address for your setup. In this example, we'll use `OWASP VM IP`, but it should be replaced with your specific IP address.

### Required Resources:
- **Kali VM** customized for the Ethical Hacking course
- **OWASP Broken Web Applications VM** (Confirm IP address before starting)
- Internet access

### Instructions:

#### Part 1: Launch Nikto and Perform a Basic Scan

**Step 1**: Launch Nikto on Kali Linux.

- Log into the Kali system with the username  and password .
- Nikto is preinstalled on Kali Linux. You can launch Nikto by either navigating through the menu:
  
  `Applications -> Vulnerability Analysis -> nikto` 
  
  Or directly from the command line.

- To view the available options for Nikto, use the following command:

  ```bash
  nikto --help
  ```

  **Question**: What command option will uncover SQL injection vulnerabilities only?

**Step 2**: Perform a basic scan on the OWASP Broken Web Applications VM.

- The OWASP Broken Web Applications VM contains various vulnerable applications. You will perform a basic scan against it to uncover vulnerabilities.

- Launch a basic scan using Nikto on the OWASP VM at **your assigned IP address** (in this example, we use `OWASP VM IP`):

  ```bash
  nikto -h OWASP VM IP
  ```

  **Note**: Use the actual IP address of your OWASP VM.

- **Note**: Nikto scans may take a few minutes to complete. To terminate a scan prematurely, press `CTRL-C`.

  **Sample Output**:

  ```bash
  + Target IP: OWASP VM IP
  + Target Hostname: owasp-bwa
  + Target Port: 80
  + Start Time: 2024-10-18 12:00:00
  + Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
  + /: The anti-clickjacking X-Frame-Options header is not present.
  + /login.php: SQL Injection vulnerability detected.
  + /admin: Apache server is outdated.
  ```

  **Question**: What kind of vulnerabilities does Nikto detect in this scan?

#### Part 2: Use Nikto to Scan Multiple Web Servers

In this section, you will scan multiple servers using Nikto.

**Step 1**: Create a text file with the list of target IP addresses.

- Use the text editor on Kali (MousePad or any editor of your choice) to create a file called `IP_list.txt`.
  
- Add the following IP addresses to the file (replace `OWASP VM IP` with your actual IP if needed):

  ```txt
  OWASP VM IP
  10.6.6.11
  10.6.6.13
  10.6.6.14
  ```

- Save the file to your home directory.

**Step 2**: Run Nikto to scan the listed IPs.

- Execute the following command to scan all the servers listed in `IP_list.txt`:

  ```bash
  nikto -h IP_list.txt
  ```

  **Question**: How many of the targets are hosting web servers? How many are running Apache?

#### Part 3: Investigate Website Vulnerabilities

Nikto provides useful information about vulnerabilities and, in some cases, references CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) or other classification systems.

**Step 1**: Investigate the CVEs for server `OWASP VM IP`.

- During the scan of the OWASP VM (`OWASP VM IP`), Nikto reports CVEs.

**Question**: What are the recommended remediation steps for CVE-2003-1418?

---

#### Part 4: Export Nikto Results to a File

Nikto allows you to save scan results in different formats, such as CSV, HTML, or TXT.

**Step 1**: Export the scan results for `OWASP VM IP` to an HTML file.

- Use the following command to export the scan results:

  ```bash
  nikto -h OWASP VM IP -o scan_results.htm
  ```

- The results are saved as `scan_results.htm` in the `/home/kali` directory. Open it in a browser to view the formatted report.

**Step 2**: Export the scan results to a CSV file.

- You can export the scan results in CSV format by specifying the `-Format csv` option:

  ```bash
  nikto -h OWASP VM IP -o scan_results.csv -Format csv
  ```

**Question**: How does the saved file differ from the output shown on the screen?

---

### Reflection:

Nikto is a powerful yet somewhat dated web vulnerability scanner. There are several other web vulnerability scanners that you can use with Kali Linux to supplement or improve on Niktoâ€™s capabilities.

**Question**: List at least one additional tool that can be used to scan websites for vulnerabilities.
