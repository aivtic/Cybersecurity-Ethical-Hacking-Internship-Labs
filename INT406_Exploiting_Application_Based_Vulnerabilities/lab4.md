# Lab 4 - Using the GVM Vulnerability Scanner

## **Introduction**

### **What is GVM?**
Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) is an open-source tool for vulnerability scanning and management. It helps security professionals identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in systems. GVM integrates several tools into a comprehensive suite, including a powerful scanner and an intuitive web-based interface, the Greenbone Security Assistant.

### **What is the OWASP Broken Web Application?**
The OWASP Broken Web Application Project is a collection of intentionally vulnerable web applications used for security testing, training, and research. These applications simulate real-world vulnerabilities, providing a safe environment for practicing scanning and exploitation techniques.

## **Objectives**
- **Part 1:** Install and configure GVM.
- **Part 2:** Scan the OWASP Broken Web Application for vulnerabilities.
- **Part 3:** Exploit a vulnerability found by GVM.

## **Required Resources**
- Kali Linux VM customized for this course.
- OWASP Broken Web Application VM with IP address: **192.168.56.101**
- Internet access.

### **Instructions**

### Part 1: Install and Configure GVM

#### **Step 1: Install GVM**
1. Open a terminal in your Kali Linux VM.
2. Update your system packages:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```
3. Install GVM using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install gvm -y
   ```
4. Configure GVM:
   ```bash
   sudo gvm-setup
   ```
   - This command may take some time as it downloads and sets up the necessary components like vulnerability definitions.

#### **Step 2: Verify Installation**
1. After the setup, verify the installation by checking the GVM services:
   ```bash
   sudo gvm-check-setup
   ```
   - Ensure all components are marked as “OK” in the output.

### Part 2: Scan the OWASP Broken Web Application for Vulnerabilities

#### **Step 1: Start GVM Services**
1. Start the GVM services:
   ```bash
   sudo gvm-start
   ```
2. Once the services start, access the Greenbone Security Assistant interface by navigating to `https://127.0.0.1:9392` in your browser.
3. Log in with the following credentials:
   - **Username:** admin
   - **Password:** admin (or the password set during `gvm-setup`).

#### **Step 2: Configure and Run a Scan**
1. Navigate to **Scans -> Tasks**.
2. Click the **Task Wizard** (magic wand icon), then select **Advanced Task Wizard**.
3. Set the task name as **OWASP Broken Web Application**.
4. Enter the target IP address: **192.168.56.101**.
5. Click **Create** to start the scan.

#### **Step 3: Analyze the Scan Results**
1. Once the scan is complete, view the report under the **Reports** column.
2. Examine vulnerabilities, paying attention to those with **High** or **Critical** severity levels.
3. Document key vulnerabilities, their descriptions, and potential impacts.

#### **Step 4: Review Open Ports**
1. Navigate to the **Ports** tab in the report.
2. Document services running on open ports and their associated risks.

### Part 3: Exploit a Vulnerability Found by GVM

#### **Step 1: Reconnaissance with Nmap**
Perform an Nmap scan to validate the findings from GVM:
```bash
sudo nmap -sV 192.168.56.101
```
Analyze the output for open ports and running services.

#### **Step 2: Exploitation**
Choose one vulnerability to exploit. For example:
- **SQL Injection:**
   1. Use SQLMap to test and exploit the vulnerability:
      ```bash
      sqlmap -u "http://192.168.56.101/vulnerable.php?id=1" --dbs
      ```
   2. Follow the prompts to extract database information.

- **XSS:**
   1. Identify an input field susceptible to XSS.
   2. Inject malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`) and observe its behavior.

Document your steps and findings, including screenshots of successful exploits.

### **Reflection Questions**
1. What are the common vulnerabilities found in web applications like OWASP Broken Web Application?
2. What steps would you recommend to secure the application based on your findings?

---

### **Submission Instructions**
Compile your findings into a detailed report. Include:
- Vulnerabilities identified in the scan.
- Exploitation steps and results.
- Answers to the reflection questions.

Submit the report as a **PDF file** via the designated platform by the due date.
